Companies have leveraged cloud compute elasticity and economies of scale to deliver projects on time and under budget, but what about the user desktops? Enable on-demand \"graphics and video editing\" users on the desktop as easily as burst EC2 cloud compute. Hire the best talent, regardless of location or time zone, while only streaming secure pixels to a user\'s desktop. In this hands-on session, attendees explore the technical schema and underlying architecture of this solution and then individually build a working Windows and Linux graphics desktop based on the NVIDIA powered G3 EC2 instance type. All attendees must bring their own laptop (Windows and macOS are supported). Tablets are not appropriate. We also recommend having the current version of Chrome or Firefox and the AWS CLI already installed.','Compute','400 - Expert','Workshop','Thursday, Nov 29','11:30 - 13:45'),

We then show you how to automatically test your code deployment and, when the test passes, to progressively shift Alexa customers\' traffic from the old version of your Lambda function to the new version. This enables you to quickly roll back your deployment in the unlikely case that you introduced a bug in the new version.','Alexa','300 - Advanced','Chalk Talk','Thursday, Nov 29','14:30 - 15:30'),

Once messages are flowing, pipelines process messages and turn them into useful data using techniques like transforms and filters. Pipelines also enrich your IoT data with data from other AWS service and external data sources. After it\'s processed, data is stored in an IoT-optimized data store. Once data is ready to be analyzed, datasets are created by querying the data or by using built-in Jupyter notebook templates for sophisticated analytics, such as machine learning.
